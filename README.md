# SPCIES

#### Suite of Predictive Controllers for Industrial Embedded Systems

This Matlab toolbox generates solvers for _model predictive controllers_ (MPC) in different programming languages.

We support various MPC formulations, providing solvers based on _first order methods_. We focus of providing solvers that are suitable for their implementation in embedded systems, either because they are sparse, or because the MPC formulation is particularly suitable for this paradigm.
