SPCIES -- Suite of Predictive Controllers for Industrial Embedded Systems

The following optimization methods are used by Spcies.
Please use spcies('help', 'method_name') to get more specific and 
in-depth information about a specific 'method_name'.

Optimization methods:
    'ADMM': Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
    'EADMM': Extended ADMM
    'FISTA': Fast Iterative Shrinking-Threshold Algorithm

Each MPC formulation may only support a subset of the above methods.
Please refer to the documentation of the MPC formulation using
spcies('help', 'formulation_name') for the list of supported methods.
Use spcies('help', 'MPC') for the list of available MPC formulations.
