This file contains tutorials explaining how to use the toolbox and its features.
Tutorial files start with a "t" followed by two numbers. We recommend following the tutorials in order.

The tutorials are:
    t00_basic_tutorial -> Learn the basics of the toolbox. Everything you need to know to get started.
    t01_time_varying_MPC -> Learn how to build and call MPC solvers whose ingredients you can change online.
    t02_plain_C_solver -> Learn how to generate solvers in plain C and compile them in a main() function.
                         (This tutorial uses the files located in the /cl_in_C directory).
    t03_real_systems -> Learn about some featured of the toolbox that help you when controlling real systems.
    t04_dev_solver_versions -> Learn about versions of the MPC solvers written in Matlab code (used for development)
