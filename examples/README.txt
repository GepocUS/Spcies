This file contains tutorials explaining how to use the toolbox and its features.
Tutorial files start with two numbers in their name. We recommend following the tutorials in order.

The tutorials are:
    00_basic_tutorial -> Learn the basics of the toolbox. Everything you need to know to get started.
    01_time_varying_MPC -> Learn how to build and call MPC solvers whose ingredients you can change online.
    02_plain_C_solver -> Learn how to generate solvers in plain C and compile them in a main() function.
                         (This tutorial uses the files located in the /cl_in_C directory).
    03_real_systems -> Learn about some featured of the toolbox that help you when controlling real systems.
    04_dev_solver_versions -> Learn about versions of the MPC solvers written in Matlab code (used for development)
